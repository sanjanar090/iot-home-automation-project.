# iot-home-automation-project.
Built a smart system using NodeMCU, Arduino Uno, and Blynk 2.0 to control home appliances from a smartphone. The system allows users to check and manage temperature and humidity levels remotely, making daily life more convenient. This project shows how IoT technology can be used in a simple and useful way for smart home solutions.
